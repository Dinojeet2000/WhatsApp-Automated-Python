A simple WhatsApp message automating project(or Automated BOT) has been made using Python.
You just simply need to use WhatsApp desktop app for this project. 

PLEASE READ THIS! ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
Guys, the code has been updated to solve this particular problem.
ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
"Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Desktop\py4e\whatsapp\wa.py", line 9, in module
    x = position1[0]
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable"

TO SOLVE THIS: AFTER YOU RUN THE PROGRAM, YOU HAVE TO QUICKLY OPEN YOUR WhatsApp WINDOW, ELSE THE ABOVE ERROR WILL POP UP AGAIN. 
So, open WhatsApp quickly after you run the code. 

Happy programming, Cheers! ðŸ¥‚
